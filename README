I studied the course 'Introduction to Computer Science' in the first semester of the first year at the university.
As part of the course, we learned to write code in the C language, along with basic programming principles as well as more advanced ones.
Here I uploaded the last 2 assignments we wrote in the course. These are quite basic programs, 
but which demonstrate the use of tools that C offers us, and mainly form the basis of all the programming knowledge that I have learned since then and that I am constantly continuing to learn.
