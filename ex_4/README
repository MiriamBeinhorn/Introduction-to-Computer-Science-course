It is a guessing game in which the players are given a game board consisting of pairs of cards, and they must find the pairs.
All the data (the size of the board, the number and names of the players, the cards themselves and their positions) are received as command line arguments.
The command line should be written in the following format:
<board_dim> <num_players> <player-1>#<player-2>#...#<player-m> <object-1> <object-2> … <object-n2⁄2> <pos-1> <pos-2> … <pos-n2>
